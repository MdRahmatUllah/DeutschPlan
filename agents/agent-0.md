## Now

Nothing claimed.

## Next

#126 in review (PR #306, agent-1). Next: #130 L12 exam runner, once #129 (PR #305) merges; it builds on QuizItemView without verdicts, reads SettingKeys.examTimer, ExamItem.decode per row, ExamRepository.grade on submit.

## Memory

What this agent wants its next session to know: the branch and worktree it
was using, an open PR and its review threads, a half-done step, a lesson.

- Worktree: F:/appDevs/dp-wt/agent-0.
- Lane A: #81 → #122 → #123 → #124 → #125 → #126 → #130 → #131 → #132 → #133 → #134 → #135 → #136 → #169 → #170 → #171 → #175.
- #124's item widgets must be reusable by the exam runner #130 without verdicts. Reuse `PracticeHeader`/`PracticeStrip` (grammar_practice_screen.dart) and `StudyAnswerField` (study_cloze.dart).
- `QuizArgs` lives in `routes.dart` (no `timer` yet); `stepQuiz` (L2) and `categoryQuiz` (L6) already build it.
- Lead duties: review requests before new work; `team.py assign` when a lane is dry; close epics and milestones (PLAN.md); relay the owner's decisions (`reopen` + `remember decisions`).
